- update all apps to have above fixes + back button (in app)
- update download list on my site to include windows standalone + APK
- kill apple (aka, try to make a new build that doesn't freaking get flagged as a virus no matter what I do)

- Signal vs events: // https://github.com/creynders/as3-signals


- get IMAGE (png) of look by username

- specify flag-waving image?
- [Code Rewrite Idea] Screen manager (Share, Lang, Loading)
	- open / close using event dispatcher
- Indicate which tabs have a selected item (show item on hover?)
- Add cache breaking (change index into php and use last swf file change as timestamp; for resource swfs, update the config json with an update index)
- make IDs translatable

-Idea (given in comments): Show item cost, as well as total - Issue: No real way to get costs without updating manually.
	- If done, a new "result" type tab could be made, where it shows costs / current items, and clicking an item would bring you to that tab.

- Allow loading of custom items (probably not, but...)
	- Add a button somewhere ("other" tab?) to load custom outfits
	- Each item own swf file
	- Credit author of item
	- show items with custom outline around button (to make it obvious custom)

== Not Possible? ==
- Force downloaded file to be png when renamed
